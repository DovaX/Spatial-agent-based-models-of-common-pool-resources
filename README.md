# spatial-agent-based-models-of-common-pool-resources

Bachelor thesis at the Institute of Economic Studies, Faculty of Social Sciences, Charles University in Prague


The thesis dealt with competition/cooperation tradeoffs and incentives in the situation where natural resource (fish, natural gas, oil) is spatially distributed. It was analyzed which conditions must be fulfilled in order to sustain cooperation in different setups from game theoretical view. In order to do that I developed C# code that simulated all of the spatial models. (1D and 2D)
